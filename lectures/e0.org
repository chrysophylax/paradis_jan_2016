* About

** Assignments and other material are at \url{https://github.com/joearms/paradis_jan_2016
}
** PDF files and assignments are at the course site on ilearn2
** It's a GIT repository. Please push changes to me. {\sl help me improve the course better}.
   
* Why?
** Erlang is Great
** Erlang powers a lot of things
(WhatsApp, Ericsson smart data ..., Alibab, and secret stuff :-)
** Elixir is great
** Programming is fun
** Best paid josbs in Silicon valley :-)
* How?
** Make lots of Mistakes

"If you don't fail at least 90 percent of the time, you're not aiming
high enough." -- Alan Kay

** Come to the lectures

Don't watch the vidoes

** Lot's of live coding
See me make really stupid mistakes :-)

** Lot's of war stories
How we got banned - how I was fired - how I made my first million etc.

* Warnings :-)

** I use the Chomsky method
(to teach X never talk about X talk about Y)
** I might get sick
(don't Google thigs if you get sick)
** I will go heavily off topic (remind me)
** I'll try to cover things in "weekly" slots
** I might talk about the TiddlyWiki
   (I will talk about it after class)

* Help me improve the course
** We start with a emacs org-mode, this file is \verb+e0.org+.
** An Erlang program \verb+orgmode_parse.erl+ transforms it into \verb+lecture_e0.tex+. This adds color coding of code and a few other nice things.
** Run \verb+pdflatex+ twice and get \verb+lecture_e0.pdf+.
** This course is being continuously updated and is possibly buggy.
** Please help me improve the material. Push all changes to github.
** There are no course credits for helping.
** \textcolor{Red}{Tell me if the examples are too easy or difficult}. They should take N hours/week. What is N?
* Tell them how wonderful make is
** some student will do this
* Building the Course Material
#+BEGIN_shell
$ git clone https://github.com/joearms/paradis
$ cd paradis/
$ autoconf
$ ./configure
$ make
#+END_shell

Problem 1 - fix Makefile.in or configure.ac to reduce output from pdflatex.
